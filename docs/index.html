<h2>Motivation and wish list</h2>

<p>
It was  
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060"> recently shown</a>
that <i>de novo</i> assembly for human genomes
from <a href="https://nanoporetech.com">Oxford Nanopore</a> reads
is possible, but computationally expensive and laborious.
The aim of this project is to
make <i>de novo</i> assembly of human genomes
possible on a routine/production basis and at reasonable 
computational cost.

For this to be possible, <i>de novo</i> assembly must be:

<ul>
<li>Fast: under one day elapsed time.
<li>Accurate: accuracy and other assembly metrics 
comparable to those provided by existing tools.
<li>Logistically simple and easy to run. 
</ul>

<p>
This project is at an early stage, and does not yet produce
assembled sequence as its final output.

<h2>Computational approach</h2>

<p>
See <a href=ShastaSlides-June2018-v2.pdf>this presentation</a>
for information on the computational approach selected.
In addition to Oxford Nanopore reads,
these methods might also apply to other long reads with high 
error rates such as those created by the
<a href="https://www.pacb.com/">Pacific Biosciences</a> DNA sequencing platforms.

<p>
In the chosen computational approach, 
an assembly runs in memory on a single, dedicated large machine 
with a large amount of memory (&asymp; 1 TB)
and a relatively large number of processors (&asymp; 32 cores). 
Input data are copied to memory, the entire assembly runs
in memory without disk access (except for log files
and small summary files), and the output is finally copied
to storage. This minimizes delays due to data movement,
and facilitates algorithmic development, as all data
structures are always loaded in memory and immediately
accessible.

<p>
The requirement for such a large machine may seem extravagant.
However, machines with these characteristics are
currently easily available at reasonable prices on the major
cloud computing platforms. 
For example, on 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">AWS EC2</a>, 
instance type <code>x1.16xlarge</code>,
with 976 GB of memory and 32 cores (64 "virtual processors"
because of hyperthreading)
is available at the time of writing for an hourly price around 
$7 (on demand pricing), 
$4 (reserved pricing), 
$2 (spot pricing).
And on <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a>, 
machine type <code>n1-ultramem-40</code>, 
with similar characteristics,
is available at similar prices.
And machines with 1-2 TB of memory are often available
as departmental machines.



<h2>Supported platform</h2>
<p>
The code is currently set up to build and run on Ubuntu 16.04.
The documentation assumes that this is the platform used
both for building and running the code.

<p> 
Porting to other Linux systems should be relatively easy,
and likely requiring just minor changes to the build process.
However this has not yet been attempted. 
If you are interested in portability to a specific Linux platform,
please open a 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues">GitHub Issue</a> 
on the repository.



<h2>Building the code from source</h2>
<p>
This section, as the rest of the documentation,
assumes that you are on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine.

<p>
If you have the necessary 
<a href=Prerequisites.html>prerequisite packages</a> installed, 
you can get a local copy of the code and build it
using the following commands: 
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>

<p>
If you are not sure if you have the necessary prerequisite packages installed, 
you can instead
use the following commands
(this assumes that you are authorized to acquire root privileges
using the <code>sudo</code> command):
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
shasta/scripts/InstallPrerequisites-Ubuntu16.04.sh
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>




<p>
This creates in the <code>shasta-build</code> directory
a <code>shasta-install</code> directory that 
needs to be copied to the machine where the code will run
and that contains the following:

<ul>
<li>A <code>bin</code> directory containing shared library
<code>shasta.so</code> and several scripts.
<li>A <code>conf</code> directory containing sample config files.
<li>A <code>docs</code> directory containing this and other documentation. 
</ul>

<p>
If your build system has more than one processor
and enough memory, you can speed up the build using the <code>-j</code>
option in the <code>make all</code> command.



<h2>Memory configuration</h2>
<p>
For efficient utilization of the large amount of memory,
the code stores data on non-swappable virtual memory supported by 
2 MB pages, as provided by the 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt">
Linux hugetlbfs filesystem</a>.
Script <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>, 
located in the <code>shasta-install/bin</code> directory, provides an easy 
way to configure memory in this way.

It takes as an argument the number of GB of memory
that should allocated to the hugetlbfs filesystem.
Most of the system memory should be configured in this way, leaving only
20-50 GB of memory allocated to standard 4KB pages.

<p>
Running <code>SetupHugePages.py</code> requires root privileges.
Usually, the simplest and safest way to achieve this is to
use the Linux <code>sudo</code> command.



<h2>Setting up a run directory</h2>
<p>
After running <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>, you can create a new directory
to contain your run. After <code>cd</code> to that new directory,
run <code>shasta-install/bin/SetupRunDirectory.py</code>.
This will create symbolic links <code>data</code> and 
<code>Data</code> pointing to filesystems on 4KB and 2MB pages respectively,
as well as a <code>threadLogs</code> directory 
to contain logs for individual threads for assembly phases
that run in parallel.

<p>
Next, you need to create a configuration file where the <code>shasta</code>
software will find values for various assembly parameters.
This configuration file must be named <code>shasta.conf</code>.
Sample configuration files are available in the 
<code>shasta-install/conf</code> directory. 
You can select one of them, copy it to the run directory
under the new name <code>shasta.conf</code>, 
and edit it to customize it as necessary for your run.



<h2>Input files</h2>
<p>
The <code>shasta</code>
software uses as input one or more 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA">FASTA</a>
files containing the input reads.
If you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ">FASTQ</a> file, 
you can convert it to FASTA using script 
<code>shasta-install/bin/FastqToFasta.py</code>.
If your FASTQ file is compressed (extension <code>.gz</code>),
you can decompress it and convert to FASTA in one step,
saving a round trip to disk, using 
script 
<code>shasta-install/bin/FastqGzToFasta.py</code>.

<p>
For each of your FASTA files, you use script
<code>
shasta-install/bin/AddReadsFromFasta.py
</code>
to load into memory the reads contained
in the FASTA file that have sufficient length.
The minimum length is controlled by parameter 
<code>minReadLength</code> 
in the <code>[Reads]</code> section
of the configuration file <code>shasta.conf</code>.
 
 
 
<h2>Running the assembly</h2>
<p>
When all input FASTA files have been loaded in this way,
you are ready to start the rest of the assembly process,
which occurs entirely in memory, without access to disk,
with the exception of log files and some small output
files containing summary information.

<p>
Because of the large memory utilization, it is recommended
that a machine be dedicated to a single assembly run.
The machine should be concurrently used for other purposes, 
and multiple concurrent runs on the same machine
are not advisable. 
If the code runs in virtualized or containerized
environments, appropriate amounts of physical resources
should be dedicated to it.
If adequate computational resources are not available,
the assembly run will crash or slow down intolerably,
and potentially crash the entire physical or virtual
machine used.

<p>
Normally, you will be assembling a human genome or
another large genome. For testing purposes,
you can also assemble a small bacterial genome.
Keep in mind, however, that the <code>shasta</code> 
sofwtare is not designed or optimized for small genomes.
