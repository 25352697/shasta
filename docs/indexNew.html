This documentation is undergoing a overhaul and is currently incomplete.
The <a href=oldDocs/index.html>old documentation</a> is still accessible, 
but is not up to date
and does not reflect significant recent changes and usability improvements.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The goal of the Shasta long read assembler is to rapidly 
produce accurate assembled sequence using as input DNA reads
generated by <a href="https://nanoporetech.com">Oxford Nanopore</a> flow cells.

<p>
Computational methods used by the Shasta assembler include:
<ul>
<li>
Using a
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding'>run-length</a>
representation of the read sequence.
This makes the assembly process more resilient to errors in
homopolymer repeat counts, which are the most common type
of errors in Oxford Nanopore reads. 
<li>
Using in some phases of the computation a representation
of the read sequence based on <i>markers</i>, a fixed
subset of short k-mers (k &#x2248; 10).
</ul>

<p>
An initial implementation of the Shasta assembler is complete and functional,
but significant improvements in several areas are possible.
As currently implemented, it can run an assembly of a human genome at coverage around 60x
in about 5 hours using a single, large machine (AWS instance type
<code>x1.32xlarge</code>, with 128 virtual processors and 1952 GB of memory).
The compute cost of such an assembly is around $20 at AWS spot market or reserved prices.

<p>
The accuracy of assembled sequence is being
analyzed. Early indications are that Shasta is similar or better 
in assembly quality when compared to other long read assemblers.
