<h1>Running a large assembly</h1>
<p>
For large assemblies, <code>shasta</code> uses Linux huge pages
(2 MB pages) for efficiency and reduced system overhead.
This section describes two different procedures that can
be used for this purpose.



<h2>Running an assembly: simplified procedure for large runs</h2>
<p>
<p>
This provides a one line command to run a large <code>shasta</code> assembly
with full performance through the usage of large pages
if full configurability and flexibility are not necessary.
Note that this requires root privileges to configure large pages.
Root privileges are obtained using the <code>sudo</code>
command. Therefore, depending on configuration, this command may
request your password.
<p>
<code>
shasta-install/bin/Run.py --inputSequences .../input.fasta
</code>
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
<li><code>--inputSequences</code> specifies the input fasta file to be used.
</ul>

<p>
This command provides a certain amount of configurability,
but  does not provide full access to all of the Shasta 
assembly parameters. 
Invoke with the <code>--help</code> for details.



<h2>Running an assembly: complete procedure for large runs</h2>

<p>
This section describes the complete procedure for a large assembly run.
For a small test run for which performance is not essential,
you can use the simpler procedure described
<a href=RunningSmall.html>here</a>.


<h2 id=memory>Memory configuration</h2>
<p>
For efficient utilization of the large amount of memory required by a large assembly,
the <code>shasta</code> code stores data on non-swappable virtual memory supported by 
2 MB pages, as provided by the 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt">
Linux hugetlbfs filesystem</a>.



<h2 id=runDirectory>Setting up a run directory</h2>
<p>
Create a new directory for your run. 
After <code>cd</code> to that new directory,
run <code>shasta-install/bin/SetupRunDirectory.py</code>.
This will create a
<code>Data</code> directory and mount on it a huge page filesystem in memory
backed by 2MB pages,
as well as a <code>threadLogs</code> directory 
to contain logs for individual threads, for assembly phases
that run in parallel. 
This command uses <code>sudo</code> to obtain root privileges when needed.  
As a result, depending on your <code>sudo</code> setup, it may
ask for your password.


<p>
Next, you need to create a configuration file where the <code>shasta</code>
software will find values for various assembly parameters.
This configuration file must be named <code>shasta.conf</code>.
A sample configuration files is available in the 
<code>shasta-install/conf</code> directory. 
You copy it to the run directory 
and edit it to customize it as necessary for your run.
The provided sample <code>shasta.conf</code>
contains assembly parameters optimized for a human
assembly at coverage around 60x.
In other situations, some of the assembly
parameters will need to be changed to
obtain good results.


 
<h2 id=running>Running the assembly</h2>
<p>
With the run directory set up as described and the
input FASTA files ready, you can run the assembly.
Just invoke <code>shasta-install/bin/RunAssembly.py</code>,
passing as arguments the names of your input FASTA files,
and the assembly will start.

<p>
To prevent interruptions of the run due to network issues
that break your ssh connection to the machine running the assembly, 
you can use the <code>nohup</code> command:

<pre>
nohup shasta-install/bin/RunAssembly.py Input.fasta 1>RunAssembly.stdout 2>&1 &
</pre>

This way, the assembly runs in the background, is not interrupted
if your terminal window is closed, and all log output
to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>
is saved to file <code>RunAssembly.stdout</code>.

<p>
Because of the large memory utilization, it is recommended
that a machine be dedicated to a single assembly run.
The machine should not be concurrently used for other purposes, 
and multiple concurrent runs on the same machine
are not advisable. 
If the code runs in virtualized or containerized
environments, appropriate amounts of physical resources
should be dedicated to it.
If adequate computational resources are not available,
the assembly run will crash or slow down intolerably,
and potentially crash the entire physical or virtual
machine used.



<h2 id=saving>Saving assembly results</h2>

<p>
The data structures created during assembly are stored in memory,
so they use valuable system resources. In addition, they are
not persistent, which means they are lost 
when the system reboots.
You can save these data structures persistently using the following
command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/SaveRun.py
</pre>

This will create directories <code>dataOnDisk</code> and
<code>DataOnDisk</code>
which are copies of <code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code>.
After this command completes, you can delete the 
contents of the <code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code> directory to free the memory 
resources they use. 

<p>
You can also restore the run in memory from the data on disk at a later time.
For this, make sure the run directory is set up and that the 
<code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code> directories are empty. Then, use the following command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/RestoreRun.py
</pre>



<p>
The <code>SaveRun.py</code> and <code>RestoreRun.py</code> commands
perform large amounts of sequential I/O to/from storage.
In some environments, the performance of this sequential I/O
can be substantially improved using the following command to
increase the size of individual I/O operations:

<pre>
blockdev --setra 65536 /dev/xvdf
</pre>

Here, replace <code>/dev/xvdf</code> with the name of the block device
that your filesystem is mounted on. The above command
requires root privileges.
The above command is particularly helpful when using
an EBS "Throughput Optimized HDD Volume" (volume type <code>st1</code>) on AWS EC2.



<h2 id=cleaningUp>Cleaning up allocated memory</h2>

<p>
After saving to disk the run results, you can clean up allocated memory
using the following command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/CleanupRunDirectory.py
</pre>

<p>
This command uses <code>sudo</code> to obtain root privileges when needed.  
As a result, depending on your <code>sudo</code> setup, it may
ask for your password.
