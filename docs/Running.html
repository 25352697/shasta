<h1>Running a large assembly</h1>
<p>
For large assemblies, <code>shasta</code> uses Linux huge pages
(2 MB pages) for efficiency and reduced system overhead.
This section describes two different procedures that can
be used for this purpose.

<p>
<b><span style='font-size:200%'>&#9888;</span>The procedures described here assume that only one such
large assembly is active on the entire machine.</b>


<h2>Running an assembly: simplified procedure for large runs</h2>
<p>
<p>
This provides a one line command to run a large <code>shasta</code> assembly
with full performance through the usage of large pages
if full configurability and flexibility are not necessary.
Note that this requires root privileges to configure large pages.
Root privileges are obtained using the <code>sudo</code>
command. Therefore, depending on configuration, this command may
request your password.
<p>
<code>
shasta-install/bin/Run.py --inputSequences .../input.fasta --memory 100
</code>
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
<li><code>--memory</code> 
specifies the number of memory GB to be allocated to large pages (2 MB pages).
<li><code>--inputSequences</code> specifies the input fasta file to be used.
</ul>

<p>
This command provides a certain amount of configurability,
but  does not provide full access to all of the Shasta 
assembly parameters. 
Invoke with the <code>--help</code> for details.



<h2>Running an assembly: complete procedure for large runs</h2>

<p>
This section describes the complete procedure for a large assembly run.
For a small test run for which performance is not essential,
you can use the simpler procedure described
<a href=RunningSmall.html>here</a>.


<h2 id=memory>Memory configuration</h2>
<p>
For efficient utilization of the large amount of memory required by a large assembly,
the <code>shasta</code> code stores data on non-swappable virtual memory supported by 
2 MB pages, as provided by the 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt">
Linux hugetlbfs filesystem</a>.
Script <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>, 
located in the <code>shasta-install/bin</code> directory, provides an easy 
way to configure memory in this way.

It takes as an argument the number of GB of memory
that should allocated to the hugetlbfs filesystem.
Most of the system memory should be configured in this way, leaving only
20-50 GB of memory allocated to standard 4KB pages.

<p>
Running <code>SetupHugePages.py</code> requires root privileges.
Usually, the simplest and safest way to achieve this is to
use the Linux <code>sudo</code> command.

<p>
After running <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>, run the following
command (shown here with sample output) 
to display the number of 2 MB pages that were
successfully configured:

<pre>
grep HugePages_Total /proc/meminfo
HugePages_Total:  460800
</pre>

The total number of pages should equal the number of GB
passed as an argument to <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>
times 512, the number of 2 MB pages in 1 GB.
On a machine that has been running for a long time,
<code>SetupHugePages.py</code> may only be able to
configure less than the requested amount of memory.
This is normal and due to memory fragmentation.
In this case, it may be necessary to reboot the system.



<h2 id=runDirectory>Setting up a run directory</h2>
<p>
After running <code>SetupHugePages.py</code>, you can create a new directory
to contain your run. After <code>cd</code> to that new directory,
run <code>shasta-install/bin/SetupRunDirectory.py</code>.
This will create symbolic links <code>data</code> and 
<code>Data</code> pointing to filesystems in memory backed by 4KB and 2MB pages respectively,
as well as a <code>threadLogs</code> directory 
to contain logs for individual threads, for assembly phases
that run in parallel.

<p>
Next, you need to create a configuration file where the <code>shasta</code>
software will find values for various assembly parameters.
This configuration file must be named <code>shasta.conf</code>.
Sample configuration files are available in the 
<code>shasta-install/conf</code> directory. 
You can select one of them, copy it to the run directory
under the new name <code>shasta.conf</code>, 
and edit it to customize it as necessary for your run.


 
<h2 id=running>Running the assembly</h2>
<p>
With the run directory set up as described and the
input FASTA files ready, you can run the assembly.
Just invoke <code>shasta-install/bin/RunAssembly.py</code>,
passing as arguments the names of your input FASTA files,
and the assembly will start.

<p>
To prevent interruptions of the run due to network issues
that break your ssh connection to the machine running the assembly, 
you can use the <code>nohup</code> command:

<pre>
nohup shasta-install/bin/RunAssembly.py Input.fasta 1>RunAssembly.stdout 2>&1 &
</pre>

This way, the assembly runs in the background, is not interrupted
if your terminal window is closed, and all log output
to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>
is saved to file <code>RunAssembly.stdout</code>.

<p>
Because of the large memory utilization, it is recommended
that a machine be dedicated to a single assembly run.
The machine should not be concurrently used for other purposes, 
and multiple concurrent runs on the same machine
are not advisable. 
If the code runs in virtualized or containerized
environments, appropriate amounts of physical resources
should be dedicated to it.
If adequate computational resources are not available,
the assembly run will crash or slow down intolerably,
and potentially crash the entire physical or virtual
machine used.



<h2 id=saving>Saving assembly results</h2>

<p>
The data structures created during assembly are stored in memory,
so they use valuable system resources. In addition, they are
not persistent, which means they are lost 
when the system reboots.
You can save these data structures persistently using the following
command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/SaveRun.py
</pre>

This will create directories <code>dataOnDisk</code> and
<code>DataOnDisk</code>
which are copies of <code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code>.
After this command completes, you can delete the 
contents of the <code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code> directory to free the memory 
resources they use. 

<p>
You can also restore the run in memory from the data on disk at a later time.
For this, make sure the run directory is set up and that the 
<code>data</code> and
<code>Data</code> directories are empty. Then, use the following command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/RestoreRun.py
</pre>



<p>
The <code>SaveRun.py</code> and <code>RestoreRun.py</code> commands
perform large amounts of sequential I/O to/from storage.
In some environments, the performance of this sequential I/O
can be substantially improved using the following command to
increase the size of individual I/O operations:

<pre>
blockdev --setra 65536 /dev/xvdf
</pre>

Here, replace <code>/dev/xvdf</code> with the name of the block device
that your filesystem is mounted on. The above command
requires root privileges.
The above command is particularly helpful when using
an EBS "Throughput Optimized HDD Volume" (volume type <code>st1</code>) on AWS EC2.



<h2 id=cleaningUp>Cleaning up allocated memory</h2>

<p>
After saving to disk the run results, you can clean up allocated memory
using the following command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/CleanupHugePages.py
</pre>
