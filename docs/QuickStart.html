<h1>Quick start</h1>
It is expected that the first Shasta release will become available in early May 2019.
When that happens, it will become very easy for users to get started using Shasta
for assembly on a variety of platforms including most current 64 bit Linux platforms, macOS, and Windows.
This can be done in three commands - more details below:
<p>
<code>
wget https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/releases/download/0.0.0/shasta-linux
<br>chmod ugo+x shasta-linux
<br>./shasta-linux --input input.fasta
</code>
<p>See below for more information, including some small changes required for macOS and Windows.



<h2>Before the first release becomes available</h2>
Before the first release becomes available, 
users are forced to build the code from source
and run the assembly using the more complex procedures described
in the <a href=oldDocs/index.html>old documentation</a>.
This requires a Linux machine running Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04
and root privilege.



<h2>When the first release becomes available</h2>
When the first release becomes available, 
users can simply download from GitHub a highly portable executable 
that has no dependencies and requires no installation or set up,
except for setting the execute permission bit.

<h3>Linux</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download the Linux static executable <code>shasta-linux</code> for your selected release. 
You can use your browser or the following command, replacing <code>x.y.z</code> with 
the release you want to use:
<br>
<code>wget https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/releases/download/x.y.z/shasta-linux</code>
<li>Use this command to set its permission bits: 
<br>
<code>chmod ugo+x shasta-linux</code>
<li>Use this command to run your assembly, making sure to specify
the correct path to the location where you stored the executable,
or to add that location to your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable:
<br><code>./shasta-linux --input input.fasta</code>
<br>You can specify multiple input FASTA files, if necessary.
On a typical laptop, this will run in minutes for a bacterial genome.
For a human size assembly, AWS instance type <code>x1.32xlarge</code>
is recommended. It is usually available at a cost around $4/hour
on the AWS spot market and should complete the human size assembly
in a few hours, at coverage around 60x.
<li>Assembly output will be created in a new directory named
<code>ShastaRun</code>. 
Output includes the assembly in FASTA and GFA 1.0 formats in files:
<ul>
<li><code>ShastaRun/Assembly.fasta</code>
<li><code>ShastaRun/Assembly.gfa</code>
</ul>
</ul>
This will work on most current 64 bit Lunix distributions. 
It was tested on at least the following Linux distributions for the 
<code>x86_64</code> architecture, but it is likely
that it will run on any Linux distribution for <code>x86_64</code>
that uses a current kernel.
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
<li>Linux Mint 18.3
<li>CentOS 7.6
<li>Debian 9
<li>Fedora 29
</ul>

<p>
Note that the procedure above does not require root privilege,
unless some non-default options are used when invoking the
executable. 
Those non-default options are, however, necessary
to achieve maximum performance.


<h3>macOS</h3>
Use the Linux directions, but change the name of the executable from
<code>shasta-linux</code>
to
<code>shasta-macOS</code>.


<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Install 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.
<li>Working in a Linux shell created using WSL, follow the directions for Linux above.
</ul>
