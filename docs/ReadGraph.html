<tr>
<th>
<th>In the alignment graph
<th>In the read graph

<tr>
<td>Each vertex represents:
<td>An oriented read (read and strand or orientation).
<td>A read.

<tr>
<td>Each read generates:
<td>Two vertices, one for each strand
<td>One vertex, for non-contained reads.
Contained reads generate no vertices.
A read X is contained if it has an alignment 
with another read Y and the alignment
covers substantially the entire read X.

<tr>
<td>The graph is:
<td>Undirected
<td>Bidirected
(see <a href='http://medvedevgroup.com/papers/wabi07.pdf'>here</a>
for more information,
in particular Fig. 1 and Section 2.2).

<tr>
<td>An edge represents:
<td>An alignment between two oriented reads.
<td>An alignment between two reads, with orientation described
by the two "arrows" of the bidirected edge.
