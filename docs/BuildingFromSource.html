<h1>Building the code from source</h1>

<h2>When is it necessary to build from source?</h2>
<p>
In many cases, you don't need to worry about building from source,
and instead you can use a release build
downloaded from the 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/releases'>Releases</a> page on GitHub. 
You only need to build from source in one of the
following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
To maximimize performance. 
See <a href=Performance.html>here</a> for more information.
<li>
To build a version of Shasta for which no release exists.
For example, if you want to get a recently added feature
that is not available in the most recent release build.
<li>
To test, develop, or debug Shasta code.
<li>
To port the Shasta build to a different platform.
</ul>




<h2>How to build from source</h2>

<h3>Build platforms</h3>
<p>
Building from source is currently only possible on an 
Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 machine.
Porting the build process to other Linux platforms is possible.
If you are specifically interested in porting to a different Linux
platorm, please file an Issue on GitHub.
Even better, submit a Pull Request with the necessary changes.

<p>
For best performance, the build process described below
creates binaries optimized for the build machine.
If you plan on using the build on a different
machine, see 
<a href='#Portability'>Build portability</a> below.



<h3>Build commands</h3>
<p>
If you have the necessary 
<a href=Prerequisites.html>prerequisite packages</a> installed, 
you can get a local copy of the latest code and build it
using the following commands: 
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>

<p>
If you are not sure if you have the necessary prerequisite packages installed, 
you can instead
use the following commands
(this assumes that you are authorized to acquire root privileges
using the <code>sudo</code> command - depending on set up you may be asked 
to enter your password):
<pre>
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
sudo shasta/scripts/InstallPrerequisites-Ubuntu.sh
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>

<p>
If your build system has more than one processor
and enough memory, you can speed up the build using the <code>-j</code>
option in the <code>make all</code> command.




<h3>Build contents</h3>
<p>
The build process described above creates in the <code>shasta-build</code> directory
a <code>shasta-install</code> directory that 
contains the following:

<ul>
<li>A <code>bin</code> directory containing the Shasta executable, 
named <code>shasta</code>, Shasta shared library
<code>shasta.so</code>, and several scripts.
<li>A <code>conf</code> directory containing sample config files.
<li>A <code>docs</code> directory containing this and other documentation. 
</ul>


<h3>Building smaller binaries</h3>
<p>
If you don't plan to use your build for debugging, you
can use command <code>make install/strip</code>
instead of <code>make install</code> as the last
step of the build process.
This will strip debug symbols from the Shaste executable and shared library, which significantly reduces
the size of the
build directory.



<h3 id=Portability>Build portability</h3>
<p>
For best assembly performance, the build process described above
creates binaries that use the full instruction set
available on the build machine (via gcc option <code>-march=native</code>).
This gives the best possible runtime performance on the build machine,
but <b>creates a build that is not necessarily portable across machines</b>.
If you run the build created in this way on a different machine
with a smaller instruction set, you may get a crash with an 
<code>Illegal instruction</code> signal.

<p>
To create a build that is portable but less performant,
add the following to your <code>cmake</code> command:
<pre>
-DBUILD_NATIVE=OFF
</pre>
<p>
This generates a build that only uses instructions
available on all <code>x64_86</code> machines.
Release builds use this option for portability.
For this reason, it is best not to use release builds
for large runs where performance is important.
See <a href=Performance.html>here</a>
for other tips to improve performance.

<p>
If you want to build a more performant but non-portable version of
a release build for your machine,
make sure to use the following command (while in the <code>shasta</code> directory) before running
the <code>cmake</code> command, replacing <code>0.1.0</code> with the desired release number.
<pre>
git checkout 0.1.0
</pre>
