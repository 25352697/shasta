<h1>Running an assembly: simplified procedure for small runs</h1>



<p>
This section describes a simplified procedure to use the
<code>shasta</code> software for a small assembly run, perhaps for testing
or experimentation.
Keep in mind, however, that the <code>shasta</code> 
software is not designed or optimized for these small assemblies.
For a large run for which performance is essential,
you can use the complete procedure described
<a href=Running.html>here</a>.



<h2 id=runDirectory>Setting up a run directory</h2>
<p>Simply create a new directory
to contain your run, <code>cd</code> to that new directory,
and run <code>shasta-install/bin/SetupSmallRunDirectory.py</code>.
This will create some required directories and symbolic links that
which cause all <code>shasta</code> binary data created during the run
to be stored on disk.

<p>
Next, you need to create a configuration file where the <code>shasta</code>
software will find values for various assembly parameters.
This configuration file must be named <code>shasta.conf</code>.
Sample configuration files are available in the 
<code>shasta-install/conf</code> directory. 
You can select one of them, copy it to the run directory
under the new name <code>shasta.conf</code>, 
and edit it to customize it as necessary for your run.


 
<h2 id=running>Running the assembly</h2>
<p>
You can now just invoke <code>shasta-install/bin/RunAssembly.py</code>,
passing as arguments the names of your input FASTA files,
and the assembly will start.
