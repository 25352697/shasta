<h1>Reporting problems or asking questions</h1>

<p>
If you bump into problems using the Shasta assembler,
or if you have questions or suggestions, 
feel free to 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues'>
submit an issue</a> on GitHub.

An effort will be made to respond to issues rapidly.
However there is currently only one person doing this,
and therefore there can occasionally be periods where
issues are not processed for one/two weeks.
