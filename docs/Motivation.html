<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>
<i>De novo</i> assembly for human genomes
from <a href="https://nanoporetech.com">Oxford Nanopore</a> reads
was first demonstrated by
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060">Jain <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>,
but at substantial computational cost and complexity.
The goal of the Shast project is to reduce
this computational cost and complexity to the point
of enabling routine and/or clinical <i>de novo</i>
assembly for human genomes.
For this, the assembler must be:

<ol>
<li>Fast: under one day elapsed time.
<li>Logistically simple and easy to run. 
<li>Accurate: accuracy and other assembly metrics must be
comparable to those provided by existing tools.
Assembly accuracy should be limited by data quality,
not by assembly algorithms.
</ol>

<p>
The Shasta assembler has fulfilled the first two goals.
An evaluation is in process regarding the third goal,
but early indications are that Shasta accuracy
is at least comparable to alternative, less performant assemblers.
