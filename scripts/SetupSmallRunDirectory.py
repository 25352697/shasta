This script can be used to set up the run directory for a small
run for which performance is not important.

All binary files are created on disk, not on the huge page filesystem.

This script creates empty directories data, data, and threadLogs directory.
It also creates symbolik links dataOnDist and DataOnDisk pointing
to data and Data respectively.

When using this script, there is not need to use SetuHugePages.py to 
set up the huge pages.

After this runs, a shasta run can be started in the current directory.
