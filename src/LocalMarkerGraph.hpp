/*******************************************************************************

The local marker graph is a directed graph in which each vertex
corresponds to a marker in an oriented read.
Consecutive markers in each oriented read are joined by an edge,
so each oriented read generates
a linear sequence of vertices in the graph.

Therefore, the local marker graph initially consists of a
separate linear sequence for each oriented read.

Then, for each marker alignment found between the oriented reads,
we merge pairs of vertices corresponding to the aligned markers.

This results in a graph that is a representation of
the alignment of the oriented reads.

This class can only handle a small number of oriented reads,
and therefore can only be used for local assemblies,
for testing/debugging. Separate code will be necessary to handle
the global marker graph.

The given oriented reads are indexed using a local oriented read id.



CLASS LocalMarkerGraph VERSUS CLASS LocalMarkerGraph2.

Assembler::createLocalMarkerGraph uses class LocalMarkerGraph
to create a local marker graph from a set of oriented reads,
without using the global marker graph.
This is computationally expensive as it requires
computations of alignments and merging of vertices.

Assembler::extractLocalMarkerGraph uses class LocalMarkerGraph2
to create a subgraph of the global marker graph.
This is computationally inexpensive as most of the computing
was done when the global marker graph was created.
