/***************************************************************************

The assembly path graph is a directed graph in which edge corresponds
to a path in the assembly graph. The path is described as an ordered
sequence of assembly graph edges.

Each vertex of the assembly path graph corresponds to a vertex
of the assembly graph, but not all assembly graph vertices
have a corresponding vertex in the assembly path graph.

The assembly path graph is used for detangling the assembly graph.

When the assembly path graph is first created, each edge stores
a path consisting of a single assembly graph edge.
However, as detangling proceeds, individual edges are combined
into longer paths.

Note that an assembly graph edhe can appear in multiple
edges of the assembly path graph.

The assembly path graph is represented as a boost::adjacency_list
from the Boost Graph library. This makes it easy to manipulate the
assembly graph path. However this also means that the assembly path
graph cannot be stored in memory mapped files like many other
data structures.
