/*******************************************************************************

Class ConsensusCaller is an abstract base class.

A concrete ConsensusCaller contains an algorithm for
computing a "best" base and repeat count at a single
position of a multiple sequence alignment.
The Coverage object contains information about read
coverage at that position of the alignment.

Derived classes must implement operator(), which must
run the consensus algorithm and return a pair containing
the "best" base and repeat count.
