# Directory shasta/AppImage

This directory build the Shasta AppImage shasta-x86_64.AppImage. 

Like the Shasta static executable, the AppImage is portable to several Linux system and does not require installation. It can be immediately run (after making it executable) without any additional set up. 

The static executable is limited to using libraries that are available in static form. The AppImage does not have this restriction, and as a result it is possible that future Shasta version will provide functionality that is available in the AppImage but not in the static executable. At present, however,  this is not the case, and the AppImage includes the same functionality provided by the static executable.

See [here](https://appimage.org/) for more information on the AppImage format.
